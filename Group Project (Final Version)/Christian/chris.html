		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<br>
		<!--Introduction-->

		<!--Skills and Languages-->
		<p>My name is Christian Cantu and I am currently a senior at the University of Houston-Downtown studying computer science. During my time at UHD, I was 			   taught the fundamental  concepts of CS such as algorithms, data structures, computer organization, and computation along with several programming 			   languages like C++, Java and Python. I mostly focus on object oriented programming since it's incredibly organized and much easier to understand, and 			   since I code through OOP, I'm utilize C++ along with Java. Besides the two languages, I like to use Python for scientific computation. I have an interest 			   in operating systems since I use linux, specifically Ubuntu, for all of my work and hopefully I can build myself an operating system from scratch one of 			   these days. </p>   
		<br>
		<!--Hobbies-->
		<p>When I'm not studying, I like to lift weights, play either my guitar, bass or synthesizer, go to punk shows (before the pandemic), take 					     film photographs, skateboard, watch foreign films, or play video games during my free time. Besides indulging in my hobbies from time to 					     time, I also like to play around with my linux operating system, such as learning the command lines, navigating the computer and the 				     directories using the command line interface only and installing and experimenting multiple distros on my desktop.</p>
